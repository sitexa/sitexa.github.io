# Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Introduction

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data to make predictions.

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns.

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning involves learning through interaction with an environment.

## Key Concepts

### Data Preprocessing
Before training models, data must be cleaned and prepared:
- **Cleaning**: Removing errors and inconsistencies
- **Normalization**: Scaling features to similar ranges
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating relevant input features

### Model Evaluation
Evaluating model performance is crucial:
- **Training Set**: Data used to train the model
- **Validation Set**: Data used to tune hyperparameters
- **Test Set**: Data used to assess final performance

## Popular Algorithms

1. **Linear Regression**: For predicting continuous values
2. **Logistic Regression**: For binary classification
3. **Decision Trees**: For both classification and regression
4. **Random Forests**: Ensemble method using multiple trees
5. **Support Vector Machines**: For classification with clear margins
6. **Neural Networks**: Deep learning approach

## Getting Started

To begin with machine learning:

1. **Learn Python**: The primary language for ML
2. **Study Mathematics**: Linear algebra, calculus, statistics
3. **Practice with Datasets**: Use platforms like Kaggle
4. **Build Projects**: Apply concepts to real problems

## Conclusion

Machine learning is a powerful tool that's transforming industries. Understanding the fundamentals is the first step toward mastering this exciting field.
